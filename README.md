# SportTracker

SportTracker - this is my first pet project.

This app serves to make it easier to conduct and monitor your workouts. It allows you to create a training schedule in advance and in real time, as well as to track the progress of your workouts.

The app is written in the architecture MVC recommended by Apple.

I used the following techniques in it:
UiKit
CoreAnimation
UserNotifications
API JSON
Libraries Realm
And did a little work with multithreading when working with animation and integration JSON

This application still has a lot of features that I would like to integrate (For example: refine the weather display, authorization using FaceID). Therefore, I will try to develop my application.
